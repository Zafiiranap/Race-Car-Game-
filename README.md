# Race-Car-Game-
The concept is about a race car whereby the latter can be moved only in the x-axis by using the right and left arrows found on the keyboard and the score is increased by collecting red hearts. Also, the race car spins upon hitting the edge of the racetrack. In addition to that, ducks appear on the racetrack at specific time interval. The game is over as soon as the race car collides with one of the ducks. At the beginning of the game (Level 1), only one duck is present on the racetrack. The number of ducks increases by 1 as the level increases. There are three levels in all. The player must score 30 points to the maximum in order to win the game.
